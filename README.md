Just in Time Datastructures
====

A just-in-time datastructire is a form of adaptive index that gradually, gracefully transitions between different behaviors and performance characteristics.  A just in time datastructure is built up out of lots of building block components that define both the physical structure and semantic constraints of a fragment of the datastructure.  General-purpose access and manipulation logic allows us to use these building blocks to emulate a wide variety of different classical datastructures, such as B-Trees, Sorted Arrays, Cracked Databases, and Adaptive Merge Trees.
